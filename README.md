# DM Manager
This is a work in progress project to help simplify my life as a DM. 

Currently it is setup as as slightly ugly map editor that allows me to build out Points of Interest on custom maps I am building for worlds, or cities.

Long term:
1. Dungeon Generatore
2. Name Generator
3. User Accounts and live sharing

## Build Guide

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
